# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Supervised Machine Learning and Credit Risk 
## Overview
The purpose of this project was to develop a supervised machine learning model that could effectivelyÂ predict credit risk. Inorder to do this the following procedure was used:
* Naive Random Oversampling using RandomOversampler
* SMOTE Oversampling
* Undersampling using Cluster Centroid 
* Combination (Over and Under) Sampling using SMOTEENN
* Balanced Random Forest Classifying
* Easy Ensemble Classifying

For each of these procedure the data was split into training and testing datasets. For each results accuracy scores, confusion matries, and classification reports were created.

## Summary
All of the credit risk analysis models have low precision in assessing whether a credit risk is high. The Ensemble models resulted in significant improvements, particularly in the sensitivity of high-risk credits. With a recall of 91 percent, the EasyEnsembleClassifier model can detect almost all high-risk credit. On the other hand, because of the low precision, many low-risk credits are still misclassified as high-risk, putting the bank's credit strategy at risk and causing it to miss out on income prospects. As a result, I would advise the bank against using any of these algorithms to anticipate credit risk.
